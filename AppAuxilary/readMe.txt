Hello,
My user was my husband,
He's name is Daniel Sheverin,
The reason that I choose him because he's a big huge user Internet, He  search a lot. He is a good creative user. 
At first when I run the app, he smiled of course because I did it :)

Strength Aspects:

- About the functionality of the App he enjoyed as user that he is able to see the current weather , 24-hours day, 7days. 
- Also be able to pick the favourite weather, and see it in main page after run again.
He likes it.

One key elements :

- when he run the app ,after a location,He likes to see a multiTask page, mean more easy Access.


My App Sketch outline:

According what I heard and my opinion, I prefer the main page be predefined list of cities, as it should be ,and when user pick the location, another page come up with selection tab which include 3 item (Current weather, 24-Hours, 7-Days), and in this page every time user pick his selection, he could be able to see details, without going forward-backward as I shown in my sketch. This is my rational opinion for improving the App design.

*****And just a quick reminder, My App run on Xcode(10.1) , Thank you *********
